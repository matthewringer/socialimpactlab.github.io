        description: "Will FrontlineSMS or FrontlineCloud increase the number of people reached by an advocacy campaign? Will it lessen the workload and cost for officers conducting surveys? Will increased volume of participation through SMS require increased organizational ability to respond to new inquiries? In this module, you’ll learn about different ways to monitor the the role of Frontline technologies in your organization’s work, starting from the earliest stages of project planning.  We’ll highlight general evaluation approaches to ICT4D and M4D, offering practical and anecdotal approaches to tracking the role of FrontlineSMS in your work." }
